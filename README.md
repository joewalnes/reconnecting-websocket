ReconnectingWebSocket
=====================

A small JavaScript library that decorates the WebSocket API to provide
a WebSocket connection that will automatically reconnect if the
connection is dropped.

It is API compatible, so when you have:

    ws = new WebSocket('ws://....');

you can replace with:

    ws = new ReconnectingWebSocket('ws://....');

Minified library with gzip compression is less than 600 bytes.

How reconnections occur
-----------------------

With the standard `WebSocket` API, the events you receive from the WebSocket instance are typically:

    onopen
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onclose // At this point the WebSocket instance is dead.

With a `ReconnectingWebSocket`, after an `onclose` event is called it will automatically attempt to reconnect. In addition, a connection is attempted repeatedly (with a small pause) until it succeeds. So the events you receive may look something more like:

    onopen
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onclose
    // ReconnectingWebSocket attempts to reconnect
    onopen
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onclose
    // ReconnectingWebSocket attempts to reconnect
    onopen
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onmessage
    onclose

This is all handled automatically for you by the library.

Manually Opening, Closing and Refreshing connections
----------------------------------------

When you create a new `ReconnectingWebSocket`, the `WebSocket` connection is created and opened for you. In the case that you need to manually close a connection, simply run the `close()` method. To open the connection back up, use `open()`. If you need to close and immediately reopen the connection, use `refresh()`.
